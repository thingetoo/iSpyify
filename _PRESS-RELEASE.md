# iSpyify

## iSpyify: An application that will test your album knowledge

## Designed for music lovers who think they know their album covers

## Summary

> Type in your favorite artist and observe the blured image on the screen. Can you guess which album it is? Well we'll make it easy for you. Select from the four choices below based on the color of the blur and the type of music your artist performs. If you guess the correct image, you'll get 10 points. If you still can't decide what the image is click on the image for it to begin to deblur. Each second that passes, you lose out on one potential point. If you get it wrong on your first guess, then you get 0 points and you will have to move on to the next question. We will keep track of the highest scores for each session that you play.
