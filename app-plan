Trivia app - play part of the 30 second clip of the song and guess the name

- must find a way to make sure the song title isn't playing during the clip

- full stack - with a database that keep tracks of the hardest songs - as a percentage of how many people got this one right or wrong


- time based:
  - leaderboard with the fatest times
  - gameify it
  - keep track of fastest times in a database (sql or nosql)

- Sort by categories
  - genre
  - year
  - related artist
  - random

  - sub categories
    - difficulty

what info do I need from spotify?
- a list of genres and the ability to search
- a list of countries and ability to search
- a list of categories


- we need to search artist to get their id's
- then we need to use ids to get the songs
  - thinking we can cache the ids that we have seen before and the top couple hundred to save the first api call

-> Try to implement a SQL database(postgres) in place of Mongo - coming from Laurie's talk
